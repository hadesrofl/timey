# Welcome

This is my TimeTracker-App. It's primary purpose was to track my Time at my university, but also being flexible with other categories. A second Goal was to train some software development skills like using new techniques (javaFX, Android) or even simple problems you have while programming some things. First of all there was the development decisions and thoughts about:

* What should the app do?
* How is its structure?`
* etc. etc.
